1. Open up the browser at localhost:4200 and view the grid. 
2. Create your own separate angular-cli application duplicating the grid.  Do not look at the code in this repo
until you have tried to do the lab yourself. 
3. For your data you may copy the assets/data/products.json to your application. ( create a data folder in your assets folder and add it there.)
